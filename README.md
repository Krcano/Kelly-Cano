## Description

This project is the updated version of my portfolio. My original portfolio used basic HTML and CSS but with this updated version I changed up the color scheme used an NPM package for the particle animation and used React components. I also added current work examples and their GitHub repositories to my portfolio. I also added icons for the ways to view my work through Github, LinkedIn. In my contact page i created a form, with validation, with three fields to send me a brief message with their name and email. In addition to updating my portfolio I have also been able to update my Github and linkedIn account with my most current information.

## Usage

To navigate to the page you want to go to click the navigation bar at the top for that page. If you would like to view my projects i've worked on you can go to portfolio and see pictures of my latest work and when you hover over them you will see the title with the deployed link, the github link and description. On the contact page there is a form where you will need to fill out all three fields before you hit submit. However if you do forget to fill one out before you hit submit, the page will remind you of which one is missing. One fun aspect of my portfolio page is the partciles in the background that allow you to interact by clicking the page and moving the particles around.
